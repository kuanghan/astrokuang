This is the Kaggle challenge at this link:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

There are 1 Jupyter notebooks and 1 python script:

- house_price_explore.ipynb: my notebook that explores the features;
- finalsub.ipynb: my notebook that runs the script finalsub.py and writes
  the final submission file;
- finalsub.py: my python script that makes features and runs ML tasks.

Just in case Github cannot render the notebooks, here are the nbviewer links:
