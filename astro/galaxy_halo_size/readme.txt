Python scripts and notebooks for analyzing the relation between the size of
galaxies and the size of their dark matter halos. We use galaxies detected by
the Cosmic Assembly Near-Infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS),
a large galaxy survey using Hubble Space Telescope, to understand how galaxy
sizes are related to their dark matter halos, especially to see if the
relation follows theoretical expectations.
