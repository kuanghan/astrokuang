We discovered a distant galaxy at redshift z=6.85 (when the universe was
about 770
million years old, or just about 6% of its current age) whose light is being
distorted by a massive galaxy cluster MACS2129 in the sky. The distortion of
light is called gravitational lensing, the phenomenon that the path of light
is curved because spacetime is curved due to the large mass of the galaxy
cluster. What's more, the way the light from this distant is distorted formed
three different images of the same galaxy on the sky. 

This discovery is significant because this galaxy likely represents the type
of galaxy that we think caused "reionization", an important event in the early
stage of the universe when most of the hydrogen atoms went from being neutral
to being ionized, which has tremendous implications on the evolution of
cosmos.
